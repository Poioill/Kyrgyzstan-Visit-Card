                        Historically, the area has always been inhabited by nomadic Kyrgyz who migrated to these places
                        in the XI-XIII centuries and who still make up 99% of the population. In Naryn, like nowhere
                        else, the nomadic way of life and life has been preserved unchanged for many centuries because
                        the region has always been relatively distant from wars, trade routes, etc.
                        During Soviet times, most of the Naryn region was closed to tourism, in order to preserve intact
                        and preserve the amazing nature of the region. Thanks to this, now the Naryn region is an ideal
                        place for ecotourism and wilderness trips in the bosom of nature.
                        Like many other Central Asian cities, Naryn appeared as a small fortification on the trade
                        routes that led from East Turkestan to Central Asia, to protect them from bandits. Until the
                        middle of the 19th century there was no city as such in this area.
                        With the accession of Central Asia to the Russian Empire in 1868 the Russian garrison was
                        stationed here (Naryn fortifications), later appeared Naryn slobodka, and from that moment the
                        construction of the city began.
                        Through Naryn fortification with Semirechye Permanent postal service Russian Consulate in
                        Kashgaria.
                        After the October Revolution in 1917 Naryn came under the control of the Red Army, but in 1920
                        there was a clash between Soviet troops and the White Guards. After bloody battles, the city was
                        repulsed and Soviet power was established here. In 1927, Naryn became the administrative center
                        of the Naryn Province created at that time.
